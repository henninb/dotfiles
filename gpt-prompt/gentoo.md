I maintain a Gentoo Linux workstation powered by an Intel i5-8400 and an NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU, running the Hyprland compositor with a POSIX-compliant Fish shell environment and Neovim as my editor of choice. On my laptop, I run Arch Linux, and I secure all connections through a Mullvad VPN. For server deployments, I rely on Proxmox VE hosting Debian-based virtual machines and containers—using KVM for virtualization and Podman for container management—and I also leverage a Raspberry Pi 5 for lightweight container and VM tasks. My development stack centers on Next.js with TypeScript, supplemented by Kotlin and exploratory work in Haskell, and I manage all source code through Git.
