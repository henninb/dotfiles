CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature implemented in web browsers that governs how web pages can interact with resources from different domains. When a web page makes a request for a resource from a different domain, the browser checks to see if the server hosting the resource allows the request. If the server does not explicitly permit the request by including appropriate CORS headers in the response, the browser blocks the request for security reasons. This prevents malicious websites from accessing resources on other domains without permission. CORS is an important security mechanism for protecting users and resources on the web, and it is widely used in modern web applications.

CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security protocol employed by web browsers to regulate the inter-domain interaction of web pages with resources. When a web page initiates a request for a resource residing on a disparate domain, the browser inspects the server's authorization to enable the request. The server's permission is determined through the inclusion of pertinent CORS headers in the response. In the absence of explicit authorization, the browser impairs the request, safeguarding against cross-domain data breach. CORS is a salient security mechanism that fortifies the protection of users and web resources, and it is ubiquitous in contemporary web applications.
