## Pineapple Ingredients:

- **Pineapple:** The main ingredient turned into something spectacular.
- **Brown Sugar:** Sweeten the sauce with brown sugar.
- **Butter:** Melting the butter will help spread the glaze evenly.
- **Cinnamon:** Adds a little sweetness with a hint of spice. Sprinkle some cinnamon overtop of the spears as well as adding it to the glaze.

## How to Grill Pineapple:

The sauce is incredible. It is a buttery brown sugar cinnamon glaze. When the pineapple cooks on the grill, the sauce caramelizes and becomes absolutely incredible on top of these! The pineapple stays juicy and grills to perfection. You will be amazed with your first bite!

1. **Making the caramelized glaze:** Lay the pineapple spears on a pan. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. Whisk together the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. (If it seems thick, I always put it in the microwave for a few seconds so that it can easily pour on top of the pineapple.)
2. **With a brush:** Spread on top of the pineapple.
3. **Grilling pineapple:** Grill for about 7-10 minutes on medium heat or until it is starting to turn golden brown. I always like to brush the excess sauce from the pan back on top of the pineapple before serving.
