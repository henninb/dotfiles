On the motherboard there will be a small jumper pins to clear the Bios password. Usually there are three or six pins. One pair for normal startup which will be covered with small plastic jumper switch, one pair to clear password (CLEAR_PWD or CLR CMOS on motherboard) , one pair to reset Bios to factory settings. You have to move the jumper to the clear password pins (or reset Bios) and boot the computer. Press F1 to enter Bios and clear or change password. Turn off PC. Next remove the jumper and place it on normal startup again.
