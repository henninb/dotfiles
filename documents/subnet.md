if I use the 10 network instead would I be able to use the second octet to represent the vlan?

If you choose to use the 10 network (e.g., 10.0.0.0/22) and want to use the second octet to represent the VLAN, you can allocate a specific range of addresses for each VLAN as follows:

VLAN 10: Range from 10.10.0.0 to 10.10.3.255
VLAN 20: Range from 10.20.0.0 to 10.20.3.255
VLAN 30: Range from 10.30.0.0 to 10.30.3.255
VLAN 40: Range from 10.40.0.0 to 10.40.3.255

By using the second octet as the VLAN identifier, you can assign unique addresses within each VLAN range. For example, 10.10.2.50 would represent an address within VLAN 10, 10.20.1.100 would represent an address within VLAN 20, and so on.

With this allocation, you can still utilize the second octet to identify VLANs while working within the 10.0.0.0/22 network.


what would the netmask look like for these?
For the VLAN allocation within the 10.0.0.0/22 network, the corresponding netmask would be 255.255.252.0. Here's a breakdown of the netmask:

First octet: 255 (all 8 bits are set to 1)
Second octet: 255 (all 8 bits are set to 1)
Third octet: 252 (11111100 in binary, as only the first 6 bits are set to 1)
Fourth octet: 0 (all 8 bits are set to 0)

Therefore, the netmask for the VLAN allocation within the 10.0.0.0/22 network would be 255.255.252.0.
