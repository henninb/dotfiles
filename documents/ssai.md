server side ad insertion

This is a technology that tends to focus on combining both videos as well as ad content. Instead of this to display on your target audienceâ€™s browser, it is usually done at CMS (Content Management System) level.

It is the opposite of client-side ad insertion whereby separate third-parties are delivering the ads.
