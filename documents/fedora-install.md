To install a minimal operating system of Fedora from a chroot environment, you can follow these steps:

Boot into a live USB or CD/DVD of Fedora.
Open a terminal and mount the root partition of your target installation to /mnt. For example, if your target installation is on /dev/sda1, you can mount it using the command:
bash
Copy code
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
Mount the required partitions such as /boot, /dev, /proc, /sys and /run by issuing the following commands:
bash
Copy code
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
sudo mount --bind /run /mnt/run
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
Note: Replace /dev/sda2 with the partition where your /boot is mounted if it's different.
Chroot into your target installation by issuing the command:
bash
Copy code
sudo chroot /mnt
Now you're in the chroot environment, update the system repositories by running the following command:
sql
Copy code
dnf update
Install the minimal packages for Fedora by running the following command:
graphql
Copy code
dnf install @core --releasever=37 --setopt=install_weak_deps=False --best --allowerasing
This will install only the essential packages needed to run a minimal operating system.
Once you have installed everything you need, exit the chroot environment by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
exit
Unmount all the partitions you have mounted earlier, by issuing the following commands:
bash
Copy code
sudo umount /mnt/boot
sudo umount /mnt/run
sudo umount /mnt/sys
sudo umount /mnt/proc
sudo umount /mnt/dev
sudo umount /mnt
That's it, you've now successfully installed a minimal operating system of Fedora from a chroot environment.
